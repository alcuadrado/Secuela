Secuela – Simple MySQL Documenter

Secuela is a really simple Ruby(1.8 and 1.9 compatible) script I’ve done some months ago.
This is my first ruby script, and done in a couple of hours, so it may have many defects.

It’s intention is to document existing MySQL (and maybe later other ) databases generating a UML diagram.

To try it, just clone the repository or download a package from github and run: ./secuela –help

Any comment would be appreciated :)
